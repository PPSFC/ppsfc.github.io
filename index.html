											<h2> Curriculum Thinker-William Doll </h2>
										</header>
										<p>					
										
										<ul>
<br><li>William Doll was one of the great philosophers of the modern times; </li> </br>

<br><li>Dr. William Elder Doll, Jr. was born January 29, 1931. He was a Postmodernist curriculum thinker. </li> </br>

<br><li>Doll studied philosophy and history at the Cornell University and graduated with a B.A degree in 1953. He obtained a Master of Arts degree in philosophy from the Boston University in 1960. After teaching and administrating in elementary and middle school for 15 years, he obtained a Ph.D. degree in education at the Johns Hopkins University in 1972. </li>


<br><li>After that, he was assistant and associate professor and chair of Education Department at the State University of New York at Oswego (SUNY-Oswego), and then professor and director of Teacher Education at the University of Redlands, and then professor and director of “Holmes” Teacher Education Program at the Louisiana State University (LSU). He held the Vira Franklin & J.R. Eagles endowed Chair as LSU between 1999 and 2007. Doll retired from LSU in 2007. </li> </br>

<br><li>Doll's scholarly study started in progressivism, moved to Piaget, and gradually shifted to Postmodernism, Chaos Theory and Complexity and their implications for school curriculum (Pinar, Reynolds, Slattery, & Taubman, 2000). </li> </br>


<br><li>Doll is among the first group of scholars who introduced complexity thinking to education in the 1980s (Gough, 2012). </li></br>


<br><li>His last position was as an adjunct professor at the University of Victoria and a visiting professor at the University of British Columbia (UBC). </li> </br>


<br><li>Doll passed away at the age of 86, on December 27, 2017 in Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada. </br></li>

<br><li>Doll’s work was most prolific during the 1970’s.  His work on the Postmodern Theory in Curriculum was based on a response to the Humanist and Behaviourist movements of the time. </li> </br>


<br><li>Postmodernism is described as “The study of nonlinear, or fractal, order.  It had its beginnings in the mid-1970’s and understanding its paradoxical qualities is one of the challenges of post modernism” (Doll, 1993). The period was characterized by educational reforms coming out of the 1970’s when especially in the USA, where curriculum development was moving away from progressivism and the laissez faire approach that was popular during the 1930’s to 1960’s.  Stakeholders such as corporations, parents and even educators and administers had started to question the linear order of education of the day; curriculum they believed had been bereft of theoretical or practical guidance.  Doll postulated that curriculum should more open and less rigid.  Learning should be more flexible, adaptable and creativity and students should ask why with the intention to becoming the why the is the answer to their society’s needs.  The1970’s was period of rapid development in industry and technology and the why questions were important and not blind acceptance. </li> </br>


<br><li>The Curriculum Theory Project was founded by William Pinar and William Doll in 1995 at Louisiana State University, it acknowledged that education was a complex endeavour which requires rigorous study, interdisciplinary, and cosmopolitan vision.  The decades to the 1970’s and the 1980’s were periods of great change and reform for education and it was philosophers like Doll who help to create the theoretical framework that facilitated the change.  In his postmodern theory he postulated that education should not be based strictly on the written content of but that students should be allowed to explore learning. </li> </br>

										<p> <ul>
<br> <li>Doll uses the term “post-modern” in referring to a paradigmatic shift in thinking from empiricism and rationalism to one in which “modern notions of truth, language, knowledge, and power” are subject to transformation (Slattery 2006). </li></br>

<br> <li>Doll suggests the major strength of post-modernism is the creation of new knowledge and the transformation of learning.
Doll consistently makes the connection between postmodernism and curriculum, instructional approaches, and teaching/learning philosophy in contemporary education. 
He draws a clear connection between the scientific, predictive bases for modernity and the scientific bases for post-modernism. </li></br>

<br> <li>Doll agrees with Dewey and believed education to be a social process, with social control exerted within the context of the experience and not outside it. What one already knows or has learned is not the end result; rather, it becomes the means by which new learning and a broadened understanding is achieved (Dewey 1938/1997).
Doll posits the purpose of curriculum in closed systems is to transmit and transfer knowledge while the purpose of curriculum in open systems is to transform knowledge.
He notes that a complex, diverse, and service-oriented society demands curricular frameworks which support knowledge creation and transformation rather than merely the transmission of information. </li></br>

<br> <li>Doll suggests that “radical intellectual, social, and political change” is causing a shift in our thinking to that which is better described as “post-structural, post-philosophical, post-patriarchal, post-industrial, post-national”
Doll’s rationale for the necessity of change and transformation is the world is changing and accepted tenets of modernism can no longer be taken for granted. Doll emphatically makes the point that post-modernism—as both a philosophical school of thought and a basis for curriculum—is in its early infancy and “is still too new to define”
From Piaget’s “equilibrium model”, Doll assimilates the concept of “self-organization”, and affirms that it is concentrated in a self-improving and self-developing system. One important factor to make self-organization work is perturbation. “A system self-organizes only when there is a perturbation, problem, or disturbance—when the system is unsettled and needs to resettle, to continue functioning” (Doll, 1993, p. 163). As for curriculum, the existence and impact of these factors should be considered at any moment, and self-organization should be used to facilitate the saltation in the students’ learning and growing process. Obviously, this view  </li></br>

									<h2>Doll’s 4 Rs</h2>
									
									<span class="image"><img src="images/lwl.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> <ul>

<br> <li> <b>Richness</b>- Doll (1993) writes that richness refers to ‘a curriculum’s depth, to its layers of meaning, to its multiple possibilities or interpretations’ (p. 176).

<br><br>In addition, Doll states that there should be, “problematics, perturbations and possibilities” as part of a rich and transforming curriculum.</br></br>

</li> </br> 


<br> <li> <b>Recursion</b> – Recursion refers to the ‘human capacity of having thoughts loop back to themselves’ (Doll,1993, p. 177).
Recursion is usually associated with the mathematical operation of iteration.  
In terms of the curriculum there is no fixed beginning or end (Dewey). 

<br><br>	The parts of the curriculum are not separated entities but are opportunities for continuous entries for discussion, reflection, and exploration (Piaget’s reflexive intelligence)</br></br>

</li> </br>


<br> <li> <b>Relations</b> – Relations refer to ‘those within the curriculum – the matrix or network which gives it richness’, and to those outside school, ‘a large matrix within which the curriculum is embedded’ (Doll, 1993, p. 179). 
<br><br> <b>Pedagogical relations and the curriculum</b> </br></br>

<br>	 The process of doing and reflecting makes curriculum richer overtime.</br>

<br>	 Students master material  to a certain predetermined level of repetitious proficiency.</br>

<br>	  Relations are developed during the course(changing conditions and situations    
        within the curriculum as time progresses result in a difference between beginning     
        and end of semester).</br>
        
<br>	  Doll supports Whitehead’s dictum, to not teach many subjects rather to teach   
        thoroughly with the central ideas being thrown to students in every possible     
        combination.</br>
        
<br>	  Curriculum needs to be created by classroom community.</br>

</li> </br>
<br> <li> <b>Rigor</b> in a postmodernist frame is different from precision. It draws on interpretation and indeterminacy. As Doll (1993) says, ‘in dealing with indeterminacy, one can never be certain one “has it right”… One must continually be exploring, looking for new combinations, interpretations, and patterns’ (p. 182). On the one hand, since the world is always changing, it is impossible for humans to master all the truths of the world.
</li> </br>

<ul>

<p><br> <b>Doll also focused on interpretation </b> </br>

<br><b>Interpretation </b> – attempt to rummage through problems, procedures and valued
results.  In order for dialogue to become meaningful and transformative, there should
be an attempt to sort out what is important. </br></p>
